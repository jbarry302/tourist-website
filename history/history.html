        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Palawan has a rich and colorful history that spans thousands of years. It is believed that the earliest human
            settlers in Palawan were the Tabon Caves Man, who lived in the island some 50,000 years ago. Over the
            centuries, Palawan has been home to various indigenous groups such as the Tagbanua, Palawano, and Batak
            tribes, who have maintained their unique cultural traditions and way of life despite the influences of
            outside forces.</p>
        <p>
            In the 16th century, the Spanish colonizers arrived in Palawan and established the town of Taytay, which
            became an important center of commerce and trade. The island later became a province of the Philippine
            Islands during the American colonial period, and played a significant role in the country's struggle for
            independence from colonial rule. Today, Palawan is a thriving and diverse province that continues to
            preserve and celebrate its rich cultural heritage and history.</p>

                <h2>Prehistoric Era</h2>
                <p>The earliest known human presence in Palawan dates back to the prehistoric era, as evidenced by the
                    discovery of the Tabon Caves. These caves contain artifacts, human remains, and evidence of early
                    human habitation, including rock art and tools. It is believed that the early inhabitants of Palawan
                    were Austronesian-speaking people who migrated from the Asian mainland and other parts of the
                    Philippines.</p>

                <h2>Spanish Colonial Period</h2>
                <p>In 1565, Spanish conquistador Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi claimed the Philippines for Spain, and Palawan
                    was one of the first provinces to be colonized. Spanish influence in Palawan lasted for more than
                    300 years, during which time the province was divided into several encomiendas (land grants) and
                    administered by various Spanish officials. The Spanish established several settlements in Palawan,
                    including the city of Puerto Princesa, and built several fortifications to protect against pirate
                    attacks.</p>

                <h2>World War II</h2>
                <p>During World War II, Palawan was occupied by Japanese forces, who used the province as a base for
                    their military operations in the Philippines. In 1944, American forces began an offensive to
                    liberate Palawan, which resulted in the infamous Palawan Massacre. Over 100 American prisoners of
                    war were burned alive by the Japanese in a tunnel in Puerto Princesa. This event, along with other
                    atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, contributed to the Allied decision to drop
                    atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </p>
