                <h2>Tagbanua Tribe</h2>
                <p>The Tagbanua tribe is one of the indigenous communities in Palawan, Philippines. They are known for
                    their unique culture and way of life that has been passed down for generations. Their language and
                    customs are distinct from other tribes in the region, and they have a deep respect for the
                    environment and natural resources that sustain their livelihood.</p>
                <p>The Tagbanua people have a strong connection to the land and sea, and their traditional livelihood
                    includes fishing, hunting, and agriculture. They have a rich oral tradition and storytelling is an
                    important aspect of their culture. They also have a unique system of governance called the Pala'wan
                    (or Pala'wanon) that is based on their cultural beliefs and practices. Today, the Tagbanua tribe
                    faces many challenges, including land rights issues and the impact of modernization on their way of
                    life. Despite these challenges, the Tagbanua people continue to preserve and celebrate their
                    cultural heritage, and their traditions remain an important part of Palawan's cultural landscape.

                <h2>Batak Tribe</h2>
                <p>The Batak are one of about 140 indigenous peoples of the Philippines. They are located in the
                    northeastern portions of Palawan, a relatively large island in the southwest of the archipelago.
                    Since ancient times, the Batak have inhabited a series of river valleys along the coastline of what
                    is today Puerto Princesa City</p>
                <p>There are only about 450 Batak remaining according to a 1990 census. Also called Tinitianes, the
                    Batak are considered by anthropologists to be closely related to the Aeta of Central Luzon, another
                    Negrito tribe. They tend to be small in stature, with dark skin and frizzy or curly-hair, traits
                    which originally garnered the "Negrito" groups their name. Still, there is some debate as to whether
                    the Batak are related to the other Negrito groups of the Philippines or actually to other,
                    physically similar groups in Indonesia or as far away as the Andaman Islands.</p>

                <h2>Tultul Chant</h2>
                <p>Tultul is a chant that can only be sung by persons possessed by
                    “Epic Heroes” called Taw Tultultulan. The act of chanting becomes a bridge between
                    these “heroes and real people”. This musical experience also serves as a prayer of
                    protection to us people by the spirits. Tultul is always chanted at night until
                    daybreak. It is prohibited to sing this epic chant when the sun shines because they
                    believe in the strong connection between the night and the sacred world. </p>

                <h2>Danggit Lamayo Cuisine</h2>
                <p>Danggit is a local term used for salted and sun-dried rabbitfish. Danggit Lamayo in Palawan is a
                    marinated danggit in vinegar with garlic and pepper. It is Palawan’s version of danggit, where it is
                    soaked first in its special marinade before it hits the pan. This dish is a popular choice for
                    breakfast with the usual egg and tomatoes on the side.</p>
